# -newOptimizing_Car_Traffic_through_Multi_Agent_Systems-with-Traffic-Light-Synchronization
The program delves into a comprehensive project that tackles the optimization of traffic flow by integrating cars and traffic lights in a multi-agent system. The primary focus lies in improving the efficiency of traffic signal timings based on the number of cars present in the vicinity. By accurately counting the neighboring cars, each traffic light is capable of dynamically adjusting the durations of red and green signals to accommodate the current traffic conditions.

A key consideration in the project is the prevention of collisions between vehicles. To address this, advanced sensing technologies are employed to enable each car to detect the presence of other vehicles on the road. By utilizing sensors and sophisticated algorithms, every car in the system is equipped to determine whether the street ahead is clear or occupied.

The overall goal of the thesis is to explore and evaluate the efficacy of this system in enhancing traffic conditions and mitigating congestion. By continuously monitoring car density in real-time and making dynamic adjustments to traffic light timings, the project aims to optimize traffic flow and improve overall transportation efficiency.

Through thorough experimentation and analysis, the thesis aims to provide insights into the impact of the proposed system on traffic congestion,and overall road network performance. It also seeks to identify potential areas of improvement and suggest future research directions to further enhance the effectiveness of the system.

Ultimately, by harnessing the power of multi-agent systems and integrating intelligent traffic management techniques, the project aspires to contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable transportation systems, leading to improved traffic conditions and enhanced mobility for urban areas
